<h1> <b> Alarm Clock </b></h1> 

This is a simple alarm clock application written in Python. It allows users to set an alarm for a specific time, and when that time is reached, it plays a beep sound and displays a message to wake up.

<h2> Features </h2>
<ul> 
  <li> <b> set an alarm </b> for any specific time today or tomorrow. </li>
<li> <b>Plays a beep sound </b> when the alarm time is reached.</li>
</ul>

<h2> <b>Requirements</b></h2>
<ul>
 <li> Python 3.x  </li> 
  <li> winsound module (built-in for Windows) </li> 
</ul>

<b> Note: </b> This code uses the winsound module, which is only available on Windows. If you're using a different operating system, you may need to replace winsound.Beep() with another sound-playing library.

<h2> <b> Usage </b> </h2>
<ul> 
<li> Run the Script </li>
<li> Enter the alarm time in HH:MM format when prompted.</li>
<li> The script will wait until the specified time, then display a wake-up message and beep.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<b> No sound on non-Windows OS: Use playsound or another cross-platform library for sound alerts.
