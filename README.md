Python Alarm Clock

This is a simple alarm clock application written in Python. It allows users to set an alarm for a specific time, and when that time is reached, it plays a beep sound and displays a message to wake up.

Features
Set an alarm for any specific time today or tomorrow.
Plays a beep sound when the alarm time is reached.
Automatically sets the alarm for the next day if the specified time has already passed.
Requirements
Python 3.x
winsound module (built-in for Windows)
Note: This code uses the winsound module, which is only available on Windows. If you're using a different operating system, you may need to replace winsound.Beep() with another sound-playing library.

Installation
Clone the Repository (or download the script directly):

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-alarm-clock.git
cd python-alarm-clock
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python alarm_clock.py
Usage
Run the script.
Enter the desired alarm time in HH:MM format when prompted.
The script will display the set alarm time and wait until that time is reached.
When the alarm time arrives, a message "Time to wake up!" will be displayed, and a beep sound will play.
Example
bash
Copy code
$ python alarm_clock.py
Enter the alarm time (HH:MM): 06:30
Alarm set for: 2024-10-31 06:30:00
# At 06:30, the script will beep and display the message:
# Time to wake up!
Code Explanation
Alarm Time Input: Prompts the user to enter the alarm time in HH:MM format.
Datetime Handling: Sets the alarm for today's date with the specified hour and minute. If the time entered is earlier than the current time, the alarm is automatically scheduled for the same time on the next day.
Loop: Continuously checks the current time against the alarm time every 10 seconds using time.sleep(10) to avoid constant checking.
Sound Alert: When the alarm time is reached, the script uses winsound.Beep() to play a beep sound at 1000 Hz for 1 second.
Troubleshooting
Alarm Doesn't Wait Until Specified Time: Make sure the break statement is inside the if block that checks if the current time is equal to or later than the alarm time.
No Sound on Non-Windows OS: Replace winsound.Beep() with a different sound-playing method, such as playsound, which works on multiple operating systems.
